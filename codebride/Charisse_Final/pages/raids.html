  			<p class="message">Described as the "Vex underworld" by the Ishtar Collective the Vault is a virtual realm within the Vex collective mind which the Vex use as a testing ground to control reality through the use of ontological warfare, as opposed to simulations. Because in this space, reality and time are altered by the Templar, Oracles and Gorgons to better suit the Vex's long-term goal of Convergence, with Atheon, Time's Conflux as its nexus processing these calculations into existence itself. The Vault also exists simultaneously across multiple alternate timelines, acting as an anchor for the Vex's operations. Its enigmatic nature at the time of discovery has lured countless Guardians to their demise, including the ill-fated Kabr, the Legionless and his fireteam.</p>

  				<p class="sugar">Crota's soul may have been banished from our world, and his brood all but demolished, but Crota himself still remains. To end this threat once and for all, a new team of six Guardians needs to enter the deepest pit of the Hellmouth and infiltrate his realm, the Oversoul Throne. Though he may seem invincible, Crota's own strength - the soul-sucking power of the Ascendant Swords - can be turned against him</p>

  				<p class="gold">Fellow Houses. Fellow Eliksni. We have found the means to apotheosis, to become machines. SIVA can make you strong, but we can show you how to wield it, to free yourself from the bonds of Ether. Find us in the wasteland and bring us an offering of SIVA. In return, we will bring you to our chamber of perfection. And we will free you.</p>

  				<p class="rainbow">Riven of a Thousand Voices is a powerful Ahamkara that formerly served Mara Sov within the Dreaming City, before being Taken by Oryx, the Taken King. She now corrupts the city from its heart, the Keep of Voices, and worked her way into Uldren Sov's mind like a parasite, bending his will in an attempt to open the gate to the Dreaming City and enable herself to enter the material world.</p>
